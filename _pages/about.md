About me
------ 
I am a computational biologist who uses sequence data to uncover how microbes work with plants and create more sustainable agricultural solutions. 



Hey, cool website template! How did you build it?
------
I barely did anything. I used a github template called Academic Pages that can be found [here](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), a [discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions), and [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) that this theme was based on.
