My name is Mengyu Liu (刘梦雨). I'm an assistant professor at Washington State University Tri-Cities. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Notre Dame in 2025 under the advice of Professor Fanxin Kong. I also work closely with Professor Insup Lee and Professor Oleg Sokolsky. I received DAC Young Fellow in 2020, ACM ESWEEK SRC in 2024, NSF CPS Rising Star in 2025.

**[Recruiting PhD students and Interns]** I am actively seeking highly motivated students for PhD students and Research Interns starts from Spring 2026 (For interns, you have to be physically at USA). If you are interested, please send me your CV, transcripts, and brief descriptions about why you want to work with me.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on cyber-physical systems (CPS), including safety, security, real-time control, and foundation models. I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning for control synthesis with formal guarantees, and CPS security under adversarial settings.

<!-- Hey, cool website template! How did you build it?
------
I barely did anything. I used a github template called Academic Pages that can be found [here](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), a [discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions), and [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) that this theme was based on. -->
